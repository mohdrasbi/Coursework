    "Bootstrap aggregating, also called bagging, is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms used in statistical classification and regression. It also reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach.\n",

By sampling with replacement, some observations may be repeated in each $D_i$ The $N$ models are fitted using the above $N$ bootstraped samples and combined by averaging the output (for regression) or voting (for classification). \n",
