Just like in human languages translation is great way to begin learning a language, but I feel that I should warn you it is not a great way to master a language.

    "1. What is Unit? Is that like void? I looked it up. Like I said in class, yes Unit is a lot like void in Java but it does have some nuances in that Unit has a value in Scala and void doesn't have a value in Java [joelabrahamsson.com/learning-scala-part-eight-scalas-type-hierarchy-and-object-equality/]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do we HAVE to declare our types in Scala? I misled you about this one in class. Scala has a *beautiful* type system and there are many places where you don't need to notate the types of a val, var, parameter, or other things. It's rather complex... I would encourage you to write your code with the types in. Then try removing the types here and there and see if your code still works. I will try to highlight some of these as we move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Noting that Scala allows us a \"syntax sugar\" to remove the “.” and “()” when executing a method of an object. Can we always do this? I may have misled you. I think I may have said its not possible. But it is. See example bellow. “curryTwoParams” takes its parameters in a way you may not have seen before. That is termed curried notation in honor of Haskell Curry. We will discuss that deeper at some point in this course along with its great friend partial function applications.\n",

    "## Test Driven Development for Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "### TDD\n",
    "Test Driven Development or TDD is not a core topic of this course but I think it is worth mentioning and using when easily applicable. TDD is the process of writing tests before you implement your code. It is still a buzz word in the software engineering industry and can be a useful tool to report on a resume. Note, in general, if you can't write a test then, chances are you don't understand the problem yet. Sometimes that is okay and that is indicative of a scenario where TDD is not practical. Here is the high-level formula:\n",
    "* write a few simple tests\n",
    "    * if you can't write a test then you need to go to the assigner and work with them to better understand the problem\n",
    "* implement just enough of a solution to solve for all of your tests (refactor your code as needed)\n",
    "* iterate until the problem is solved completely\n",
    "\n",
    "One cool exercise to try sometime is a roman numberal translator [https://dzone.com/articles/roman-numerals-kata-tdd-and].\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Easy\" Recursion\n",
    "There are a lot of differnt ways that we can learn recursion. Each person is differnt in how they think an learn. I find this to be particularly evident as people attempt to master recursion. If the content displayed in the course material doesn't make sense to you, let a member of the course staff know offline and we will try to tackle the problem with you in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about \"easy\" recursive problems is as follows:\n",
    "* there are one-or-many base cases\n",
    "* there are inductive cases that rely on your base case\n",
    "* there might be edge casses\n",
    "    * in my experience, these are often due to limitations of using a computer to solve the problem\n",
    "    * sometimes the problem will naturally have an edge case\n",
    "\n",
    "### tie them together\n",
    "In my experience, if a problem is easy to solve with recursion, that same problem is also easy to solve with Test Driven Development. Using both of them together can help you learn both of these tools at the same time and better learn each tool individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Fibbonacci\n",
    "Perhaps the easiest example of this is the factorial problem, but we solve that last week. Let's instead look at the fibinocci problem. The fibbonacci sequence is a mathmatic description of a phenomina found in nature that has many applications in a variety of diciplines. By nature of this being an inductively defined mathmatic problem I would consider this an \"easy\" recurssion problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not a master of sets, and I no one is asking you to understand this notation (we'll cover it a bit but Theory of Computation - TOC - is a course you want to take if you think sets are interesting). Having said that, consider the following set definition of the fibonaci sequence: \n",
    "\n",
    "F = {1, 1, ..., F(n-1) + F(n-2) | n >= 2} \n",
    "\n",
    "In maths, I could restate the above definition as:\n",
    "* F(0) = 1\n",
    "* F(1) = 1\n",
    "* F(2) = 2 = F(2-1) + F(2-2) = F(1) + F(2-2) = 1 + F(2-2) = 1 + F(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n",
    "* F(3) = 3 = F(3-1) + F(3-2) = F(2) + F(3-2) = 2 + F(3-2) = 2 + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "* F(n) = ??? = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have seen some inductive logic (a topic well look deeper at on Thursday) and now we might have enough information to start coding a solution to the fibonaccie problem.\n",

    "#### Notes\n",
    "Note, this isn't the ideal way to solve Fibonacci. First of all there is a matter of the stack on our machine and the way our language handles this stack. Recursion can be quite resource intensive and can cause us to \"blow the stack\" (not like in Altered Carbon, this just means we've overloaded the space available). We can get around that issue using a data structure known as the trampoline monad. We'll cover trampolines later in this course. I don't think we'll bother covering monads this semester but the following video is quite comprehensive on the topic of monoid, monad and the state monad (a different monad from the trampoline): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said all of that, recursion is not the fastest way to solve fibonocci on a machine, its just an \"obvious\" way to solve it. Take a course on Algorithms to learn about some other options for solving this particular problem (or google it).\n"

    "#### Observations\n",
    "In tail recursion we often need to provide an extra parameter to our function with a known value for our base case. For this reason, many people will code it in an interior function - think about the UX here, if we have that parameter in the outer function this would be a somewhat difficult function to call\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "Some functions have a preference toward tail recursion. I probably will never tell you what languages have this preference. It's just something that you should be aware of and look up as you learn new languages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why we care\n",
    "Understanding tail recursion will be useful as we move forward in the class. We'll look at more interesting ways to solve the problem using recursion including the use of trampoline and partial function application with early returns (I forgot the technical term for that one...).\n",
